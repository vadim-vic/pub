The complexity of a model is understood as the minimum description length of the combination of the sample and the classification or regression model. Suboptimal complexity is understood as an approximate estimate of the minimum description length, obtained with Bayesian inference and variational methods. We introduce probabilistic assumptions about the distribution of parameters. Based on Bayesian inference, we propose the likelihood function of the model. To obtain an estimate for the likelihood, we apply variational methods with gradient optimization algorithms. We perform a computational experiment on several samples.},

	Analysis of the phase component of the images for such areas, called

The quality of the model is defined by the difference between the documents, which experts assess as relative to the request, and the ranked ones. To boost the model quality a modified genetic algorithm was developed. It generates models as superpositions of primitive functions and selects the best according to the quality criterion. The main impact of the research if the new technique to avoid stagnation and to control structural complexity of the consequently generated models. To solve problems of stagnation and complexity, a new criterion of model selection was introduced. It uses structural metric and penalty functions, which are defined in space of generated superpositions. To show that the newly discovered models outperform the other state-of-the-art IR scoring models the authors perform a computational experiment on TREC datasets. It shows that the resulted algorithm is significantly faster than the exhaustive one. It constructs better ranking models according to the MAP criterion.

  abstract = {The thesis provides a solution for the problem of automatic generation
	and validation the quantitative mathematical models. The considered
	models are used for describing the results of measurements and experiments.
	In the thesis we investigate a fundamental problem of automatic model
	generation for in the data analysis field. The generated models are
	used for approximation, analysis and forecasting the results of experiments.
	To generate a model we consider the expert-given requirements on
	the model structure. This consideration allows us to construct the
	interpretable models that adequately describe the results of measurements.
	To construct an adequate model we use expert-given basic functions
	and a set of generation rules. The model is represented as a superposition
	of the basic functions. The generation rules define the admissibility
	of superpositions and exclude the generation of isomorphic models.
	We propose to develop the existing methods of automatic model generation.
	In particular, we propose to consider expert requirements to the
	model structure and to rank the models according to the expert preferences.
	The proposed methods of the isomorphic superpositions search are
	based on the isomorphic subgraphs search and on the substitution
	of graphs. We investigate the methods and algorithms of model generation,
	their properties, complexity and stability. While solving an applied
	problem of mathematical modeling, the existing knowledges and expert
	information about model structure are often insufficient to construct
	the efficient model. Lack of the independent variables makes the
	methods of model and feature generation very perspective. The idea
	of feature generation based on the generation of the new independent
	variables - images of the original variables over the set of successive
	mappings. This mappings are called the basic functions. Previously
	the applied problems were considered in terms of the present approach.
	The basic functions construction and feature generation approaches
	were used for the economic and industrial problems. While solving
	this problems, the researchers didn’t investigate the existence,
	completeness and correctness of the proposed algorithm. In the thesis
	we develop the theoretical validation of correctness and admissibility
	of the superpositions generation methods and the methods convergence.
	We propose methods of optimization of the model structure. The group
	method of data handling, an example of the model generation method,
	was considered by A.G. Ivakhnenko. In the case of linear model the
	method generates new features using the multiplication operation.
	Using the Kolmogorov-Gabor polynomials, the algorithm generates the
	models of different complexity by the set of criteria. As a result,
	the method finds the model of optimal complexity described by an
	equation or a system of equations. An important stage of development
	of regression models was a consideration of non-linear models. This
	approach is widely described by G. Seber: he considered construction
	and parameter estimation for the non-linear models. To estimate the
	parameters, there was propose a Levenberg-Marquardt method. J. Koza
	and N. Zelinka proposed a symbolic regression technique for inductive
	model generation. The method found an optimal model from the set
	of superpositions by the genetic programming. The inductive model
	generation was used to solve an applied problem of the optimal antenna
	form determination. V.V. Strijov developed the ideas of the inductive
	model generation by using the coherent Bayesian inference for the
	parameter estimation. While analysing the model structure, the most
	convenient way of the superposition representation is a graph-tree.
	Thereby the methods of graph transformation are applied to the superpositions.
	This methods allow us to describe formally the structure optimization
	procedures. We consider categorial representation of graph transformations
	and conditions of the rules usability. For the trees transformation
	we use the elementary patterns of graphs and construct the isomorphic
	graphs of the more complex structure.},

  school = {Russian Academy of Sciences, Computing Center},

  address = {Ìîñêâà},
  abstract = {The thesis is devoted to the problem of model selection for regression
	and classification. According to the proposed approach, the models
	are selected from the inductively generated set. We propose to analyse
	the distribution of model parameters to choose the model of optimal
	complexity. There are two ways to construct the models, describing
	an observed data: mathematical modelling and data analysis. Models
	of the first type can be interpreted by the experts in the field
	of study [Krasnoshchyokov: 2000]. Models of the second type perform
	more efficiently, but don’t always have a clear interpretation [Bishop:
	2006]. An actual problem of theoretical computer science is to combine
	advantages of the two approaches to obtain efficient interpretable
	models. The key issue is to construct the adequate regression and
	classification models for the forecasting problems. The problem is
	to find the models of optimal complexity describing the data with
	given accuracy. An additional restriction is an interpretability
	of the models for the expert in the field of study. The goal of research
	is to propose and investigate methods of model selection from the
	inductively generated set. The problem of model selection from the
	countable successively generated set is novel. To formulate the problem
	setting we used the broad material in the fields of model and feature
	selection, that is one of the key problems in the machine learning
	and data analysis area. The basic problem of study is to develop
	the methods of the successive models generation and of the parameters
	distribution estimation. The estimations of parameter covariance
	matrices are used for simplification the model selection procedure.
	The key challenge of this problem is the parameters estimation of
	the big number of structurally complex regression models. Relation
	between model generation and selection problems was investigated
	by A.G. Ivakhnenko in the early 1980s. According to the proposed
	group method of data handling [Ivakhnenko: 1981, Madala: 1994], the
	model of optimal structure can be found by the successive generation
	of linear models using the Kolmogorov-Gabor polynomial of the independent
	variables. The criteria of optimal model structure is given by the
	cross validation procedure. Unlike the GMDH, the symbolic regression
	method [Koza: 2005, Zelinka: 2008] generates arbitrary non-linear
	superpositions of basic functions. In the last years the problem
	of model complexity analysis for symbolic regression became significant
	field of study [Hazan: 2006, Vladislavleva: 2009]. Initially the
	methods of inductive model generation were proposed in terms of the
	group method of data handling. The structure of superposition was
	defined by the external quality criteria. Afterwards this criteria
	were explained in terms of data generation hypothesis and the Bayesian
	inference. To solve a problem of successive model generation, there
	arises a problem of estimation of the superposition elements informativity.
	In terms of the Bayesian regression [Bishop: 2000], to estimate informativity
	the probability density of model parameters is used. The probability
	density is a parametric function; its parameters referred to as hyperparameters
	[Bishop : 2006]. The hyperparameters analysis can be regarded as
	one of model selection methods. For the modification of the non-linear
	models superposition there was proposed an optimal brain damage method
	[LeCun: 1990]. According to this method, an element of the superposition
	is regarded as non-informative, if the saliency value of an error
	function doesn’t exceed the given threshold. The model selection
	problem is one of the key problems of the regression analysis field.
	One of the present model selection methods is the minimum description
	length principle. The MDL principle chooses the best compressed efficient
	model [Grunwald: 2005]. The problem of models comparison is investigated
	in detail by [MacKay: 1994-2003]. As an alternative to the information
	criteria [Burnham: 2002, Lehman: 2005], there was proposed a coherent
	Bayesian inference. The first level estimates the model parameters.
	The second level makes the hyperparameters adjusting. According to
	this method, the chance to select more complex model, at the comparable
	values of the error function, is less. The principles of the Bayesian
	approach in the linear model case were proposed by the authors [Celeux:
	2006, Massart: 2008, Fleury: 2006]. At the same time, the mentioned
	principles and approaches remain open the questions investigated
	in the present thesis. By this reason we propose to create and develop
	the theory of regression model generation and selection. The problem
	is as follows. The set of models of the given class is inductively
	generated by the set of parametric basic functions given by the experts.
	Each model is an admissible superposition of the basic functions.
	The models interpretability is guaranteed by the expert-given basic
	functions, that are the basic elements of the model superposition.
	Each class of models is defined by the rules of superposition generation.
	The required model accuracy achieved by the consideration of the
	wideness of the basic models class. The optimum criteria includes
	the concepts of model complexity and accuracy, as well as the data
	generation hypothesis. Along with the parameter estimations, the
	proposed method estimates the model hyperparameters. Using information
	about the hyperparameters, the method estimates informativity of
	the superposition elements and optimizes the superposition structure.
	The optimum criteria, given by the data generation hypothesis, allows
	to choose the optimal models. Thus, we propose a new approach to
	the formulated problem. The set of models is generated inductively
	from the set of basic functions given by the experts. Each model
	is considered as the admissible superposition of the basic functions.
	Together with the parameters estimation we propose to estimate the
	hyperparameters of the parameters distribution. Using the parameter
	estimations we measure the informativity of the superposition elements
	and optimize the model structure. We choose the optimal model according
	to the quality criteria given by the data generation hypothesis.
	Ñonstruction of the new methods of model selection for the classification
	and regression is a major and actual problem of the recognition theory.},

  abstract  = {To compare objects or alternative decisions one must evaluate a quality
	of each object. A real-valued scalar, which is corresponded to the
	object, is called an integral indicator. The integral indicator of
	the object is a convolution of the object features. Expert estimations
	of one expert or an expert group could be indicators, too. We consider
	a problem of indicator construction as following. There is a set
	of objects, which should be compared according to a certain quality
	criterion. A set of features describes each object. This two sets
	are given together with an «object/feature» matrix of measured data.
	We select the linear model of the convolution: the integral indicator
	is the linear combination of features and their weights. So, to construct
	the integral indicator we must find the weights of the given features.
	To do that we use the expert estimates of both indicators and weights
	in rank scales. To compute indicators, according to the linear model,
	one can use the expert set of weights. In the general case the computed
	indicators do not match the expert estimations of indicators. Our
	goal is to match the estimated and the computed integral indicators
	by maximizing a rank correlation between them. We consider the set
	of the estimated indicators and the set of the estimated weights
	as two cones in spaces of indicators and weights, respectively. Our
	goal is to find the set of weights such that the distance between
	this set and the cone of the expert-given weights must be minimum.
	Using the found weights we compute the set of integral indicators
	such that the distance between this computed set and the cone of
	the expert-given integral indicators must be minimum, as well. This
	methodology is used for the Clean Development Mechanism project evaluation.
	The project partners have to prove that their project can yield emission
	reductions in developing countries, which could not be achieved in
	the project’s absence. The proposed integral indicators are intended
	to evaluate the environmental impact of this projects.},

	daily periodicals as well as non-periodical events. The energy price
	and consumed volume time series; the time series of consumer sales
	volume could be the examples. The generalized linear autoregressive
	models are used to forecast these time series. The samples of the
	main time-period of the time series correspond to the features of
	the forecasting models. To boost the quality of the forecast, two
	problems must be solved. First, we must select a set of features,
	which forms the model of optimal quality. Second, we must split the
	time series on the periodical and eventual segments and assign a
	model of optimal quality of each type of segments. To solve these
	problems, we estimate the distribution of the model parameters using
	coherent Bayesian inference. The optimal model for a given time-segment
	has the most probable value of maximum evidence, which is estimated
	under conditions of the stepwise regression: the features are added
	and deleted from the active feature set towards the evidence maximizing.
	The splitting procedure includes analysis of the model parameters
	distributions. Consider two forecasting models that are defined on
	their non-intersecting consequent time-segments. These models are
	different if the Kullback-Leibler distance between the distributions
	of their parameters is statistically significant. In this case the
	time-segment split is fixed; otherwise we consider the models equal
	and join the time-segments. The proposed approach brings the most
	precise time-segment splitting than the dynamic time warping procedure
	and causes increase of the forecasting quality. As an illustration
	we discuss the automatic detection of seasonal sales and promotions

	The constructed model will be used to solve problems of the Financial
	Sector: it might be a scoring model, an energy consumption forecast
	model or European option volatility smile model. We suppose that
	given historical data are not sufficient to discover hidden dependencies
	in an investigated problem. So we propose the following approach
	to the model construction. Together with historical data we use expert-given
	set of primitive functions. It is recommended to collect functions,
	which already widely used to model the investigated problem. Then
	we assign a generating function, which will be used to generate the
	set of the competitive models. We estimate evidence of the models
	using coherent Bayesian inference and select a model of the best
	structure. Since generating functions make a countable set of models,
	we organize an iterative generation-selection procedure. Each cycle
	of the procedure include the following steps. First, we modify competitive
	models so that the structural distance between an original and a
	derivative model will as minimal as possible. Second, we estimate
	parameters and hyperparameters of the derivative model to cut-off
	some model modifications at the following steps and reduce the algorithm
	complexity. Third, we analyze the evidence of the derivative model
	to find the probability to become it a model of the optimal structure.
	Also, we analyze some restrictions applied to the model structure
	and robustness of the model. As the result we obtain a model, interpretable
	from the expert’s point-of view; if fits historical data well and
	robust. Some additional tests are applied to verify the result model:
	cross-validation and retrospective forecasting to ensure quality
	of the further use.},

  pages     = {49},
  abstract  = {Indices are necessary to compare objects united in a set according
	to a certain criterion. For example, the objects are national protected
	areas or power plants. An index is a number, which is corresponded
	to an object. In this research an algorithm for construction of quality
	indices using expert estimations is developed. Consider an indices
	construction problem. A set of comparable objects and a set of features
	are given together with an “object-feature” matrix of measured data.
	Expert estimations of indices and estimations of importance features
	are given. A model of indices computation is chosen. In the general
	case the computed indices don’t coincide with the expert estimates
	of the indices. The computed importance weights don’t coincide with
	the expert estimations of importance weights, too. One has to compute
	indices, which are based on measured data with the condition: the
	indices must not contradict given expert estimations. There two approaches
	to the problem were suggested. The first one is the unsupervised
	indices construction. It finds the model parameters such that provide
	the maximal value of a selfdescriptiveness criterion. The second
	approach is the supervised indices construction. The model parameters
	were set such that provide the minimal value of the distance between
	the computed indices and their expert estimations. Now the third
	approach is proposed. According to this approach the experts can
	resolve the contradiction between expert estimations of indices,
	importance weights and measured data. At that, there is a hyperparameter
	embedded in the model. Its value corresponds to importance either
	the indices or the feature weights.},

  title     = {Model selection in classification problems (PhD thesis supervised by V.V. Strijov)},
  school    = {Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology},
  year      = {2017},
  abstract  = {The problem of constructing multimodels in the classification problem
	is investigated. The task of classification is basic in machine learning,
	and the problems of multiclass classification can be effectively
	reduced to solving one or more problems of two-class classification.
	The tasks of the two-class classification are the problem of determining
	the presence of the disease in the patient according to the set of
	his analyzes, the task of analyzing the texts to get the mood of
	the messages and the task of credit scoring. These tasks are relevant
	in connection with the spread of remote diagnostics, automatic decision-making
	systems.
	
	
	Logistic regression, which is the standard in credit scoring, and
	other generalized linear models do not allow to take into account
	the heterogeneity in the data, in particular the dependence of the
	importance of the feature on the object, and therefore are not optimal
	in its presence. To take into account inhomogeneities in the data,
	classifier compositions are used. The methods for constructing the
	model composition allow one to take into account the inhomogeneity
	in the data by constructing a multimodel containing several single
	models. Models in the multi-model can be close or coincident, which
	leads to uninterpretability and a decrease in the quality of the
	forecast. In the work offer heuristics for thinning the ensemble
	of models in the bagging. Genetic algorithms are used to select a
	subset of models in keying. In the works, clustering models and choosing
	a single representative for each cluster are used. The papers offer
	a greedy strategy of gradually increasing the number of classifiers
	in bagging. To control the number of models, use a priori sparse
	distribution of the weights of the models in the mixture. The structure
	of the mixture is sought by maximizing the validity. However, these
	methods of thinning mixtures do not take into account the proximity
	between models, and therefore the multimodel can still contain close
	models. To obtain statistically distinguishable models in multimodels,
	an external thinning procedure is used, based on a statistical comparison
	of models by calculating distances between a posteriori parameter
	distributions for different models, for example, using Bregman divergences
	or f-divergences. In this paper it is shown that the existing similarity
	measures distinguish the noninformative model and the coincident
	informative one, and therefore do not allow to build an adequate
	multimodel. To solve this problem, a similarity function is proposed
	that allows solving the problem of statistical differentiation of
	models. The proposed approach allows to take into account heterogeneities
	in the data, to obtain an adequate multimodel containing fewer models
	and having a better quality of classification.
	
	
	The presence of redundant or multicorrelated features affects not
	only the quality of the classification of the constructed model,
	but also its stability. To solve the task of selecting characteristics
	in this paper, the Bayesian approach uses the principle of maximum
	validity for determining the structure of models. To solve the problem
	of multicollinearity of attributes, a set of non-multicollinear features
	is constructed by optimizing the quality criterion. In this paper
	it is shown that the approach associated with the selection of characteristics
	is not optimal. It is proved that the method of maximum validity
	does not allow to take into account the dependencies between the
	signs, since the estimate of the maximum validity for the covariance
	matrix of characteristic weights is asymptotically degenerate. For
	optimal accounting of information from multicollinear features, it
	is suggested that they be combined.},

Such information is called expert information, and the machine learning method based on expert information is called expert-augmented learning. It is assumed that the set of shapes is approximated by the set of local models. Each local model based on expert information approximates one shape on the contour image. To construct the models, it is proposed to map second-order curves into a feature space in which each local model is linear. Thus, second-order curves are approximated by a set of linear models.

  abstract      = {The paper addresses the problem of human activity recognition based on data from wearable sensors. Human activity recognition depends on a wide context of actions. Activities can not be recognized from the local shape of sensor signals only. We propose a solution to the problem of human activity recognition applied to labour monitoring. The solution is based on the hierarchical representation of activities as sets of low-level actions. Viewing activities as sequences of actions allows exploring activities in a more condensed representation than time series. The hierarchical representation provides an interpretable description of studied activities in terms of actions. To obtain this hierarchical representation, one must first solve the problem of low-level action recognition. Though widely studied, the problem of action recognition requires overcoming several difficulties. Firstly, we show that using noise-aware self-learning methods can significantly improve classification quality in human activity recognition. Since time series are human-labeled, errors are inevitable and abundant. Noisy labels significantly worsen classification quality. Noise-aware learning allows for relaxing requirements for labeling precision and lower annotation costs. Secondly, we propose an algorithm of automatic pattern selection to generate low-level descriptions as an alternative in an unsupervised manner. The proposed method is based on Eamonn Keogh’s time series indexing methods. We introduce local PCA projections to make the method more robust to spatial rotations of a wearable device.},

  abstract = {This paper investigates the dimensionality reduction problem for signal decoding. Its main application is brain-computer interface modeling. The challenge is high redundancy in the data description. Data combines time series of two origins: design space: brain cortex signals and target space: limb motion signals.  High correlations among measurements of complex signals lead to multiple correlations. This case studies correlations in input and target spaces that carry heterogeneous data. This paper proposes feature selection algorithms to construct a simple and stable forecasting model. It extends ideas of the quadratic programming feature selection approach and selects non-correlated features that are relevant to the target. The proposed methods take into account dependencies in both design and target space and select features which fit both spaces jointly. The computational experiment was carried out using an electrocorticogram  (ECoG) dataset. The obtained models predict hand motions using signals of the brain cortex. The partial least squares (PLS) regression model is used as the base model for dimensionality reduction. The PLS algorithm obtains the best result, which reduces space dimensionality using the QPFS.},

  abstract = {The paper investigates the distillation problem for deep learning models. Knowledge distillation is a metaparameter optimization problem in which information from a model of a more complex structure, called a teacher model, is transferred to a model of a simpler structure, called a student model. The paper proposes a generalization of the distillation problem for the case of optimization of metaparameters by gradient methods. Metaparameters are the parameters of the distillation optimization problem. The loss function for such a problem is the sum of the classification term and the cross-entropy between the responses of the student model and the teacher model. Assigning optimal metaparameters to the distillation loss function is a computationally difficult task. The properties of the optimization problem are investigated to predict the metaparameter update trajectory. An analysis of the trajectory of the gradient optimization of metaparameters is carried out, and their value is predicted using linear functions. The proposed approach is illustrated using a computational experiment on CIFAR-10 and Fashion-MNIST samples and synthetic data.},

  abstract  = {This paper investigates the problem of optimal distance function selection to optimize the distance between multivariate time series. The dynamic time warping method of univariate time-series defines the warping path and uses its cost as the distance function. To find this path it uses various pairwise distances between time-series. This work examines a generalization of the time warping algorithm in case of multivariate time-series. The novelty of the paper is the comparison of various metrics between the multivariate values of time-series. The distances induced by L1 , L2 norms and cosine distances are compared. This work also proposes the multivariate adaptation of the optimized time warping algorithm. The experiment runs subsequence search and clustering problems for multivariate time-series. The given cost functions are evaluated on three data sets: two data sets with labeled physical human activity data from wearable devices and coordinates and the pressing force in the process of writing characters.},

An amount of parameters in the model is considered as a model complexity. The proposed method is based on a differential architecture search algorithm (DARTS). Instead of optimizing structural parameters of the architecture, we consider them as a function depending on the complexity parameter. It enables us to obtain multiple architectures at one optimization procedure and select the architecture based on our computation budget. To evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm, we conduct experiments on the Fashion-MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets and compare the resulting architecture with architectures obtained by other neural architecture search methods.},

  abstract  = {Neural network structures have a critical impact on the accuracy and stability of forecasting. Neural architecture search procedures help design an optimal neural network according to some loss function, which represents a set of quality criteria. This paper investigates the problem of neural network structure optimization. It proposes a way to construct a loss function, which contains a set of additive elements. Each element is called the regularizer. It corresponds to some part of the neural network structure and represents a criterion to optimize. The optimization procedure changes the structure in iterations. To optimize various parts of the structure, the procedure changes the set of regularizers according to some schedule. The authors propose a way to construct the additive regularization schedule. By comparing regularized models with non-regularized ones for a collection of datasets the computational experiments show that the proposed method finds efficient neural network structure and delivers accurate networks of low complexity.},
